NAME OF THE DATASET: Caesarian Section Classification Dataset
SOURCE: UCI Machine Learning Repository
ABOUT THE DATASET: It contains information on the medical histories of 80 pregnant women who underwent cesarean section (C-section) deliveries. 
                   The dataset includes features such as age, delivery number, previous C-section, blood pressure, and heart problem.
                   
---> Completed this project as a part of my Data Science and Machine Learning internship with the United Network of Professionals(UNP).

KEY HIGHLIGHTS:

1. Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset in detail.
2. Built various classification models namely Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Bagging, KNN Classifier, Adaptive Boosting Classifier, Xtreme Gradient Boosting Classifier and ANN Regressor
3. Compared the results to recommend the best classification model.
